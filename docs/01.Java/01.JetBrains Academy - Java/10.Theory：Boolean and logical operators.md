- ## Boolean type

  The `boolean` is a data type that has only two possible values: `false` and `true`. This is also known as the **logical type**.

  This type is a common way in programming languages to represent something that has only two opposite states like *on* or *off*, *yes* or *no*, etc.

  If you are writing an application that keeps track of opening and closing a door you'll find it natural to use `boolean` to store current door state.

  ```java
  boolean open = true;
  boolean closed = false;
  
  System.out.println(open);   // true
  System.out.println(closed); // false
  ```

  

  Important, you cannot assign an integer value to a `boolean` variable. In Java, 0 is not the same as `false`.

  

  ## Logical operators

  Variables of the `boolean` type are often used to build logical expressions using logical operators. Java has four logical operators **NOT**, **AND**, **OR** and **XOR:**

  - **NOT** is a unary operator that reverses the boolean value. It is denoted as `!`.

  ```java
  boolean f = false; // f is false
  boolean t = !f;    // t is true
  ```

  - **AND** is a binary operator that returns `true` if both operands are `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`. It is denoted as `&&`.

  ```java
  boolean b1 = false && false; // false
  boolean b2 = false && true;  // false
  boolean b3 = true && false;  // false
  boolean b4 = true && true;   // true 
  ```

  - **OR** is a binary operator that returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`. It is denoted as `||`.

  ```java
  boolean b1 = false || false; // false
  boolean b2 = false || true;  // true
  boolean b3 = true || false;  // true
  boolean b4 = true || true;   // true
  ```

  - **XOR** (**exclusive OR**) is a binary operator that returns `true` if boolean operands have different values, otherwise, it returns `false`. It is denoted as `^`.

  ```java
  boolean b1 = false ^ false; // false
  boolean b2 = false ^ true;  // true
  boolean b3 = true ^ false;  // true
  boolean b4 = true ^ true;   // false
  ```

  The **XOR** operator is used less often than others. Just remember that Java has it. If you really need it, you can use it.

  ## The precedence of logical operators

  Below are the logical operations sorted in order of decreasing their priorities in expressions: `!` (NOT), `^` (XOR), `&&` (AND), `||` (OR).

  So, the following variable is `true`:

  ```java
  boolean b = true && !false; // true, because !false is evaluated first
  ```

  To change the order of execution you can use round brackets `(...)`.

  ## An example: trekking

  As an example, let's write a complex boolean expression that determines the possibility of trekking in summer and in other seasons. Let's suppose that the right conditions for trekking is warm dry weather in summer and autumn.

  ```java
  boolean cold = false;
  boolean dry = true;
  boolean summer = false; // suppose now is autumn
  
  boolean trekking = dry && (!cold || summer); // true, let's go to trek!
  ```

  Do not get confused in the expression above, otherwise, you will go trek in bad weather! A programmer should understand not only arithmetic but also logical operations.

  ## Short-circuiting evaluation

  An interesting thing is that the `&&` and `||` operators don't evaluate the second argument if it isn't necessary. When the first argument of the `&&` operator evaluates to `false`, the overall value must be `false`; and when the first argument of the `||` operator evaluates to `true`, the overall value must be `true`. So:

  - `false && ...` -> `false`, since it is not necessary to know what the right-hand side is;
  - `true || ...` -> `true`, since it is not necessary to know what the right-hand side is.

  This behavior is known as **short-circuit evaluation** (do not confuse it with [an electrical short circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_circuit)). It reduces the computation time, but can also be used to avoid some errors in programs. We will discuss this in the following topics.
