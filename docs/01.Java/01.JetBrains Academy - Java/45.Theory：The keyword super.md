Sometimes when we define a new subclass we need to access members or constructors of its superclass. Java provides a special keyword `super` to do this. This keyword can be used in several cases:

- to access instance fields of the parent class;
- to invoke methods of the parent class;
- to invoke constructors of the parent class (no-arg or parameterized).

Let's consider all of these cases with examples.

## Accessing superclass fields and methods

The keyword `super` can be used to access instance methods or fields of the superclass. In a sense, it is similar to the keyword `this`, but it refers to the immediate parent class object.



The keyword `super` is optional if members of a subclass have different names from members of the superclass. Otherwise, using `super` is the right way to access hidden (with the same name) members of the base class.



**Example.** There are two classes: `SuperClass` and `SubClass`. Each class has a field and a method.

```java
class SuperClass {
    
    protected int field;

    protected int getField() {
        return field;
    }
    
    protected void printBaseValue() {
        System.out.println(field);
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    
    protected int field;

    public SubClass() {
        this.field = 30;  // It initializes the field of SubClass
        field = 30;       // It also initializes the field of SubClass
        super.field = 20; // It initializes the field of SuperClass
    }

    /**     
     * It prints the value of SuperClass and then the value of SubClass
     */
    public void printSubValue() {
        super.printBaseValue(); // It invokes the method of SuperClass, super is optional here
        System.out.println(field);
    }
}
```

In the constructor of `SubClass` , the superclass field is initialized using the keyword `super`. We need to use the keyword here because the subclass field hides the base class field with the same name.

In the body of the method `printSubValue` , the superclass method `printBaseValue` is invoked. Here, the keyword `super` is optional. It is required when a subclass method has the same name as a method in the base class. This case will be considered in the topic concerning overriding.

## Invoking superclass constructor

Constructors are not inherited by subclasses, but a superclass constructor can be invoked from a subclass using the keyword `super` **with parentheses**. We can also pass some arguments to the superclass constructor.


::: warning
Two important points:

- invoking `super(...)` must be the first statement in a subclass constructor, otherwise, the code cannot be compiled;
- the default constructor of a subclass automatically calls the no-argument constructor of the superclass.
:::

**Example.** Here are two classes `Person` and `Employee`. The second class extends the first one. Each class has a constructor to initialize fields.

```java
class Person {

    protected String name;
    protected int yearOfBirth;
    protected String address;

    public Person(String name, int yearOfBirth, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // getters and setters
}

class Employee extends Person {

    protected Date startDate;
    protected Long salary;

    public Employee(String name, int yearOfBirth, String address, Date startDate, Long salary) {
        super(name, yearOfBirth, address); // invoking a constructor of the superclass
        
        this.startDate = startDate;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // getters and setters
}
```

In the provided example, the constructor of the class `Employee` invokes the parent class constructor for assigning values to the passed fields. In a way, it resembles working with multiple constructors using `this()`.
