- ## List of relational operators

  Java provides six relational operators to compare numbers:

  - `==` (equal to)
  - `!=` (not equal to)
  - `>` (greater than)
  - `>=` (greater than or equal to)
  - `<` (less than)
  - `<=` (less than or equal to)
  
  The result of applying a relational operator to its operands will be boolean (`true` or `false`) regardless of the types of operands.
  
  ## Comparing integer numbers
  
  Relational operators allow you to easily compare, among other things, two integer numbers. Here are some examples below:
  
  ```java
  int one = 1;
  int two = 2;
  int three = 3;
  int four = 4;
  
  boolean oneIsOne = one == one; // true
  
  boolean res1 = two <= three; // true
  boolean res2 = two != four;  // true
  boolean res3 = two > four;   // false
  boolean res4 = one == three; // false
  ```
  
  Relational operators can be used in mixed expressions together with arithmetic operators. In such expressions, relational operators have lesser priorities than arithmetic operators.
  
  In the following example, first of all, two sums are calculated, and then they are compared using the operator `>`.

  ```java
  int number = 1000;
  boolean result = number + 10 > number + 9; // 1010 > 1009 is true
  ```
  
  The `result` is `true`.
  
  ## Joining relational operations using logical operators

  In Java, you cannot write an expression like **a <= b <= c**. Instead, you should join two boolean expressions using logical operators like `||` and `&&`.

  Here is an example:
  
  ```java
  number > 100 && number < 200; // it means 100 < number < 200 
  ```
  
  Also, we can write parts of the expression in parentheses to improve readability:
  
  ```java
  (number > 100) && (number < 200);
  ```
  
  But parentheses are not necessary here because relational operators have a higher priority than logical operators.
  
  Here is a more general example of variables.

  ```java
  int number = ...             // it has a value
  int low = 100, high = 200;   // borders
  
  boolean inRange = number > low && number < high;  // joining two expressions using AND.
  ```
  
  The code checks if the value of `number` belongs to a range.
  
  So, logical operators allow you to join a sequence of relational operations into one expression.
  
  ## An example of a program
  
  Suppose there are three children in the sports class. You want to check if their heights are arranged in descending order. The following program reads three integer numbers `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` and then checks if `h1 >= h2` and `h2 >= h3`. Note that **h** means **the height of a child**.
  
  ```java
  import java.util.Scanner;
  
  public class CheckDescOrder {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
  
          int h1 = scanner.nextInt();
          int h2 = scanner.nextInt();
          int h3 = scanner.nextInt();
  
          boolean descOrdered = (h1 >= h2) && (h2 >= h3);
  
          System.out.println(descOrdered);
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Here are several input-output pairs:

  **Input 1**
  
  ```java
  185 178 172
  ```
  
  **Output 1**
  
  ```java
  true
  ```
  
  **Input 2**
  
  ```java
  181 184 177
  ```
  
  **Output 2**
  
  ```java
  false
  ```
  
  It is possible not to use an additional variable to store the boolean result before output:
  
  ```java
  System.out.println((h1 >= h2) && (h2 >= h3));
  ```
  
  But when your condition is quite long, it is hard to understand what the code does without some explanations. A variable with a good name provides such an explanation.
