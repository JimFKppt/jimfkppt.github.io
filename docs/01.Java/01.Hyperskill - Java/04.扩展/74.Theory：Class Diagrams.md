When you work on a project, you might need a proper visual representation of a system structure. If you can divide your project into a set of objects and use the Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP) on it, you can use **Class Diagram**. It would help you to describe the components of your application and better understand the connections between them.

If you are working on an application that uses OOP, Class Diagram will define your project structure and will make it apparent to the developers.

## What is a class diagram?

In Unified Model Language (UML), **Class Diagram** is a visual representation of an object-oriented structure. To describe said structure the diagram uses the following elements:

- Classes;
- Class attributes;
- Class methods;
- Class relationships.

These elements form a set of classes and relationships between them. Such structure provides a better understanding of connections within a system and allows us to easily demonstrate the contents of an object.

## Description of a class

Class is a representation of an object that describes its methods and attributes. Simply put class can be seen as a blueprint for an object. When the system creates a specimen of an object, it will be created according to a template that was described by the class. Here's an example of a class, called "*Student"*:

*Student* has 2 attributes: *Name* defined by String type, and *Age* defined by int type. The class also has 2 methods: *write()* which returns String type and *study()* which returns nothing. Methods also have brackets that can be filled in with some parameters. In this example, we have the parameter *String str* that is required to activate method write*()*.

Each element of a class has a visibility option, defined before the name of the element. In this example, all the elements have a "+" before their names. That means that all the visibility options of these elements are set to **public**. Let's elaborate on these visibility options:

- \+ (**Public**) – element can be accessed by any class in the system;
- \- (**Private**) – element can be accessed only by a class that owns it;
- \# (**Protected**) – element can be accessed by classes that have a generalization (or inheritance) relationship with its class;
- ~ (**Package**) – element can be accessed by classes that are located in the same package.

## Description of class relationships

*Class relationships* are a concept that defines connections between classes. For example, we have 2 classes in our applications: *Student headman* and *Teacher*. We define their connection by establishing a relationship of some sort. Here's an example:

In this example, we use the type of relationship called **generalization (or inheritance)**. Let's elaborate on the relationship types:

- **Generalization (inheritance) –** a type of relationship where one class could be described as a child class which assumes and could use methods of a parent class. In our case *Student headman* is the child class of *Teacher.* This relationship could be visualized by this arrow below:

- **Dependency –** a type of relationship that indicates that some change in one class can affect another class. Here's an example of *Student* depending on *School*:

- **Realization** – the relationship between the blueprint class and the object containing its respective implementation level details. For example, we have a class *Person* which describes the basic attributes of a person. It's a blueprint that can be made into an object that represents a specific person like a *Student*, or a *Salesman*. Our *Student* class can study and go to school, and our *Salesman* class can go to work and sell stuff, but they are people, so they will have *Age* and *Name* attributes. Here's how you could visualize it:

## Description of association relationships

**Association –** a type of relationship that indicates that instances of one class are connected to instances of another. For example, *Teacher* teaches *Student.* This relationship can be visualized by a straight line:

![img](https://ucarecdn.com/5ee2f4d4-92c6-4c2f-b93c-965194c91271/)

Association relationships could also include a **cardinality** attribute. Simply put, this attribute defines the number of instances of a class that could exist in this relationship. Here's how it can be visualized for different situations:

![img](https://ucarecdn.com/1f35163c-b76b-404f-b2cf-d6f7cd459e3a/)

A basic example of this concept is this: class *Teacher* and class *Student* are connected by an association relationship. It means that *Teacher* teaches *Student*. One student can have one or multiple teachers, and the same can be said about teachers. So the diagram that describes this relationship would look like this:

![img](https://ucarecdn.com/f3eae881-ffd9-4d6a-add7-9451ed0426b9/)

Association relationships also have two special types:

- **Aggregation** – a special type of association relation that describes one class as a part of the other. Classes in this relation have a separate lifespan. If we come back to our *Student* example, we can describe class *Student* as part of *a Group*. This relation can be represented in this way:

![img](https://ucarecdn.com/e876ec6f-8bef-4277-a367-1118233a49d2/)

- **Composition** – a special type of aggregation, where classes share lifespan. If the main class (*School*) stops its functions, the class that is a part of it (*Group*) will stop functioning too. This relationship can be visualized like this:

## Conclusion

Class Diagram could be seen as too complicated at first. But when you start working on your first project, making your first framework, and connecting all the components into one structure, you may realize that this way of presenting project structure is really helpful. It makes all the application components look more apparent, and it also helps to set boundaries of their contents.
