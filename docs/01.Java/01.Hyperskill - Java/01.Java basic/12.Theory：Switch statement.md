- ## When a conditional statement is not so good

  Suppose you need to write a program that performs different actions depending on the value of a variable. For example, choosing an action from the menu of a game. To do that you can use a conditional statement with multiple branches as shown below.

  ```java
  int action = ...; // a certain value from 1 to 4
          
  if (action == 1) {
      System.out.println("Starting a new game...");
  } else if (action == 2) {
      System.out.println("Loading a saved game");
  } else if (action == 3) {
      System.out.println("Displaying help...");
  } else if (action == 4) {
      System.out.println("Exiting...");
  } else {
      System.out.println("Unsuitable action, please, try again");
  }
  ```
  
  Of course, this code handles the task. But if your conditional statement has a lot of branches, it can be hard to understand for people.
  
  ## Three keywords: switch, case, and default
  
  **The switch statement** provides a way to choose between multiple cases based on the value of a single variable (not an expression!). The variable can be an integer number, character, string, or enumeration. The last two types will be studied further.
  
  Using the switch statement, the previous code will look like this:
  
  ```java
  switch (action) {
      case 1:
          System.out.println("Starting a new game...");
          break;
      case 2:
          System.out.println("Loading a saved game");
          break;
      case 3:
          System.out.println("Displaying help...");
          break;
      case 4:
          System.out.println("Exiting...");
          break;
      default:
          System.out.println("Unsuitable action, please, try again");
  }
  ```
  
  As you can see, this code is well-structured and easier to read than the equal conditional statement. We have not explained the keywords `switch`, `case` and `break` yet, but you can already guess what they mean.
  
  ## The general form of the switch statement
  
  The most general form of the switch statement is the following
  
  ```java
  switch (variable) {
      case value1:
          // do something here
          break;
      case value2:
          // do something here
          break;
      
      //... other cases
      
      case valueN:
          // do something here
          break;
      default:
          // do something by default
          break; // it can be omitted
  }
  ```
  
  The `switch` and `case` keywords are always required here. The keywords `break` and `default` are optional. The keyword `break `stops the execution of the whole switch statement, not just one case.
  
  If a `case` does not have the `break` keyword, the following `case` will be evaluated as well, including the `default` case. The `default` case is also evaluated if there's no other `case` that matches the variable value. The `break` keyword in the `default` branch is optional and can be omitted.
  
  A `case` section may contain any block of code, even a nested `switch` statement, however it is recommended to avoid deeply nested code structures wherever possible.
  
  ## An example with "zero", "one" and "two"
  
  Let's consider another example. The following code outputs the names of integer numbers or a default text. This switch statement has three base cases and a single default case.
  
  ```java
  int val = ...;
  switch (val) {
       case 0:
           System.out.println("zero");
           break;
       case 1:
           System.out.println("one");
           break;
       case 2:
           System.out.println("two");
           break;
       default:
           System.out.println("The value is less than zero or greater than two");
  } 
  ```
  
  If the `val` is 0, the code prints:
  
  ```java
  zero
  ```
  
  If the `val` is 1, the code prints:
  
  ```java
  one
  ```
  
  if the `val` is 10, the code prints:
  
  ```java
  The value is less than zero or greater than two
  ```
  
  If you forget the keyword `break` in a case, the compiler won't consider it an error. Let's remove it from the second case (case 1) and assign 1 to `val`. The program prints:
  
  ```java
  one
  two
  ```
  
  Omitting `break` keyword is not a good practice. Try to avoid it.
  
  Java 12–14 introduced some new features allowing to use **switch** as an [expression](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/16036).
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  When you have a limited number of cases to choose from, switch statements can help you avoid unnecessary nested *if-else* constructions. For that, you need the `switch` keyword to introduce the value to evaluate, and `case` for each of the possible values. Do not forget to also use the `break` keyword to avoid evaluating extra cases and `default` branch to indicate the default behavior.
